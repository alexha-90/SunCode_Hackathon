removing site survey and augmented reality original concept. Sticks with Tesla prompt 2 closely:
----------------------------------------
tricky programming, but language agnostic. Lot of room for UI participation, user flow, improvements


input1: roof type.
input2: If rectangle, measure height and width. If hipped, measure top, bottom, one side
input3: how many panels needed (see extra)

dynamically generate a rectangle or trapezoid based on inputs

then:
using pyramid coding challenge style pattern,
make roofs: hipped (trapezoid), gable (rectangle) as buttons.

^dynamically created using for loops where 1ft x 1ft = one button


all start off as white, then onclick:
two colors: green = module builder, red = obstruction or dormer

module size (in landscape) = 54 <---> ^36
assume 60x36 or 5x3squares
assume we need 12" perimeter (1 box) every side from an obstruction
mark all perimeter boxes (CFC) as red. Can be done manually or automatically

once a 5x3 square is identified, full module built. make unclickable and darken, input text node by counter variable
reduce module count by 1. work way to zero.


assume perfect dimensions from installer



extra: see how many panels are needed given monthly usage. Assuming no shading.

cycle through historic google earth images (hot or not?) before starting.
Multiply panels needed by factor. Aka 4/5 hot = 20% more panels needed.
ex: https://www.gogreensolar.com/pages/how-many-solar-panels-do-i-need
if 650kWh/mo, need 4000W system (13 300W panels).
with 20% shade, need 4000W * 1.2 = 4800W (16 300W panels)
